//javascript - synchronous
             - single threaded
default behaviour of js

//execution context - 
                    - execute one line of code at a time
                    - each opr waits for each other
                    - we have callstack and memory allocation

//blocking code Vs Non-blocking code                                   

there are two types of code in JS as per above mentioning

// as per the name 
# in blocking code read file in sync means till the file reading you cant do anything that is mean by synchronous
# in non blocking code all the vice versa you can read file asynchronously while doing your other work that is known as non blocking code by using async in JS

//if we try to register by using database and after storing user will get the message that your data get stored  
//in this case we write the non blocking code beacuse after the storing the data it will display the msg only
